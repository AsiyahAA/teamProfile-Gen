# teamProfile-Gen
## Description
### Project purpose was to generate an HTML file with team profiles generated by user input. User would enter in information on team members (team manager, engineer, and intern) using the inquirer extention and it would populate all of the user input into an HTML file which when opened in a brower would show the information with clear and minimal styling. In additon, tests were to be run in order to ensure the code was working properly using the jest extention.
## User
### User should be able to see questions in the command-line terminal regarding information about the team (such as name, email, role, and id) and be able to enter in answers to those questions. Once answers are entered, user has the ability to add in more members to the team or to finish building the team which will then generate an HMTL file with all the information supplied by the user inside of it. Once User opens the HTML file in a browser, User should be able to see a profile on each team member with email and gitHub links working properly.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create JavaScript files to clone starter code and make other code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new JavaScript folders if there is no started code provided. Starter code folders should be copied onto your own repository and inquirer version 8 should be installed using the terminal in VS code. Run the commands npm init -y, npm install inquirer@8, and then npm install to get additional files needed (such as package.jon, gitignore, etc). Also install jest to run tests on your code (run the command npm i jest to install). Once all is installed, start coding and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the JavaScript file.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. 
### Screencastify was also used in recoridng a walk-through demostration of the readMe generator.

## Status 
### HTML generator is functioning properly with user input being collected and generating a new HTML file with all the correct information. Unfortunetly, tests are not working properly and show as failed which can be worked on in future review.
